# Distraction Reducer Plugin

## Overview
The Distraction Reducer plugin helps players focus on other things outside of OSRS by reducing visual distractions. When enabled, it overlays a customizable black screen while you're engaged in specific skilling actions, allowing you to concentrate on your task without being distracted by the game's visuals. When a click is needed the screen will return to normal.

## Features
- Supports multiple skilling activities:
  - Woodcutting
  - Fishing
  - Mining
  - Cooking
  - Herblore
  - Crafting
  - Fletching
  - Smithing
- Customizable overlay color and opacity
- Individual toggles for each supported skill
- Automatic detection of skilling activities
- Brief delay before activation to prevent flickering during short pauses

**Note:** Shooting stars are not yet supported by this plugin.

## How It Works
1. The plugin detects when you're performing a supported skilling activity by monitoring your character's animation.
2. If the corresponding skill toggle is enabled, the overlay will activate after a short delay (to prevent flickering during brief pauses).
3. The overlay will disappear shortly after you stop the skilling activity or become idle for more than 2 game ticks.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have RuneLite installed and updated to the latest version.
2. Open the Plugin Hub within RuneLite.
3. Search for "Distraction Reducer" and click "Install".

## Usage
1. Enable the plugin in RuneLite's plugin list.
2. Configure the settings to your preference.
3. Start skilling, and the overlay will automatically activate when appropriate.
